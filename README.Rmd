`shinyrems` is an app that allows you to visualize and download data from the EMS database.

## Installation

To install the latest development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov/shinyrems)
``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("bcgov/shinyrems")
```

## Usage

The app has 4 run modes: 

+ **"demo"**
+ **"2yr"**
+ **"historic"**
+ **"all"** 

Each run mode has different data requirements.  

+ If using **"2yr"**, **"historic"** or **"all"** run mode, you will be prompted to download or update the data onto your machine prior to the app being launched. This requires internet!  

+ If using **"historic"** and **"all"**, the data downloaded is in excess of 4gb!  

+ If you only require data since 2018-01-01, the **"2yr"** run mode works with a smaller dataset and the app will run a little faster.

To simply run the app without having to download any data first, use the "demo" run mode:
```
shinyrems::run_app(run_mode = "demo")
```

For the other run modes, simply substitute "demo" with one of the other options, e.g.:
```
shinyrems::run_app(run_mode = "2yr")
```
